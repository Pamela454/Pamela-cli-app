CLI Urgent Care is a Command Line Interface application that returns current wait times at Carewell Urgent Care centers for towns in Massachusetts. COVID-19 testing is available at appointments at all locations. Urgent care is usually needed quickly but not serious enough to require an emergency room visit. This uses the Nokogiri and Watir gems to scrape data from the website. 

## Prerequisites

This application requires the following:
  Ruby 2.5.6 or later


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'UrgentcareCLI', '~> 0.2.5'
```

And then execute:

    $ gem install UrgentcareCLI

TODO: Run bundle exec Urgentcare to start the application. Enter a town number from the menu in the terminal to see more detailed information about that location. The detailed information gives the name, phone number, address, and earliest available appointment time at that location.
